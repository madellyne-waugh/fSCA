fSCA - functional/featural Sound Change Applier

I know there are other people who have similar projects out there, but I
haven't looked at their projects or code; they just provided the inspiration.
If you want to see this kind of project done by someone who knows what
they're doing, look up HaSC by user chris_notts on the ZBB
(https://verduria.org).

ok so goals/design:

	- IPA/phonetic-based sound change applier
	- rules:
		- romanization -> IPA
			- (need support for unicode chars)
			- could maybe be at top of sc rule file
		- sound change rules (general format of "target > new /env")
			- want more general rules relating to vowel changes,
			  like being able to do unstressed vowel syncope etc.
			- user doesnt have to define categories unless they differ
			  from default/don't correspond to phono. features
			- user can do things like {a,e,o}i > i
			- oh that gives me idea: unconditional changes have blank env field
		- convert back to romanization
			- (maybe have some kind of neutral metalinguistic romanization?)

	- input:
		- wordlist (can be separated by whatever delim)
		- romanization/sound change file, one rule per line
			- also where user-defined cats would go
			- rules look like
				C[-voice] > C[+voice] /V_V

	- output:
		- line-by-line, each line is of form
			populum > pueblo
		- user has option for output file to be in IPA
		- also option for debug information about what rules apply where
